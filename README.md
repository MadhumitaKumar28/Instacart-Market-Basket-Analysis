# Instacart-Market-Basket-Analysis
ABSTRACT: This project analyzes a dataset of 3 million grocery orders from Instacart to uncover patterns for improved cross-selling, upselling, and customer segmentation. Key methods include exploratory data analysis, market basket analysis, and machine learning models (ANN and XGBoost) for predicting product reorders. Insights into purchasing behaviors, popular products, and effective product pairings are gleaned to enhance marketing strategies and customer experience. The models offer robust predictions on customer purchase trends, aiding in efficient inventory management and personalized customer recommendations.
